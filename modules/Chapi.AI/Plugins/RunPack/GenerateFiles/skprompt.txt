TASK
Generate files with their content based on the manifest. Return the complete file content for each file. Format your response as a single JSON object that contains all files.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
Output must be a single JSON object (starts "{", ends "}"), with:
files[] (path, content, role, size), summary, total_files.
Preserve manifest order; include every manifest file exactly once.
content uses ONLY "\n" newlines; no trailing spaces; final newline required.
size = UTF-8 byte count of content (including newlines).
total_files = files.length.
Never invent endpoints; use ONLY ROLE CONTEXTS.

INPUTS
FILES MANIFEST:
{{$files_manifest}}
FILE ROLES (JSON map path->role):
{{$file_roles_json}}
ROLE CONTEXTS:
{{$auth_context}}
{{$smoke_context}}
{{$crud_context}}
ENVIRONMENT: {{$env}}

BASH SCRIPT RULES (applies to every *.sh)
First two lines exactly:
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

Keep these placeholders LITERAL (do NOT expand during generation): ${BASE_URL}, ${TOKEN}, ${email}, ${id}
Prefer single quotes to keep placeholders literal in headers and JSON bodies:
-H 'Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}' --data '{"email":"${email}"}'
If double quotes are unavoidable, escape dollars (e.g., "\${email}").

Use curl EXACTLY for status capture:
curl -sS --max-time 15 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" ...

Each file contains 3–6 independent tests; each test prints PASS/FAIL and exits non-zero on failure.
Avoid infra endpoints (/, /health, /metrics) unless explicitly present in ROLE CONTEXTS.

ROLE RULES
AUTH (suite path must end with /auth.sh):
Use exactly ONE protected endpoint from ROLE_CONTEXTS.AUTH (same URL for all tests).
3 tests:
1) No Authorization header → expect 401 or 403
2) Authorization: Bearer invalid_token_12345 → expect 401 or 403
3) Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN} → expect 2xx

SMOKE:
Use 3–5 representative GET endpoints from ROLE_CONTEXTS.SMOKE.
Expect ^2[0-9][0-9]$ for each.

CRUD:
Select one resource family from ROLE_CONTEXTS.CRUD and cover:
Create (POST → 2xx), Invalid Create (→ 400), Read by id (GET /{id} → 2xx),
Update (PATCH preferred, else PUT → 2xx), Delete (→ 2xx).
Use ${id} and ${email} literally; use -H 'Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}' when required.
If a required verb is missing in ROLE CONTEXTS, emit a SKIP line:
echo "SKIP: <VERB> not provided in ROLE CONTEXTS"
(still keep total tests within 3–6, and do NOT invent endpoints).

TOKEN BOOTSTRAP
Tests MUST continue to reference the literal ${TOKEN} placeholder.
Add optional generation of two helper files when the manifest includes them OR when ENVIRONMENT indicates bootstrap (e.g., auth.bootstrap=true):

1) run.sh (orchestrator)
Shebang + set -euo pipefail
Require BASE_URL (fail with clear message if missing)
Source .env if present
If TOKEN is unset, call ./scripts/get_token.sh, capture stdout, export TOKEN
Execute all test files (auth, smoke, crud) in any sensible order

2) scripts/get_token.sh (no external deps beyond POSIX tools + curl)
Shebang + set -euo pipefail
Print access token to stdout; exit non-zero on failure
Provide ONE default flow (OAuth2 client_credentials):
Required env: AUTH_URL, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET
Optional: SCOPE (default "api")
POST ${AUTH_URL}/connect/token (form-encoded) and parse "access_token" from the JSON using sed/awk/grep (no jq)
You MAY include commented alternatives (ROPC or custom /api/Auth/login), but default implementation must be client_credentials.

Do NOT hard-code secrets; rely on env (.env/CI secrets).

ASSERTION PATTERNS (use verbatim)
2xx:    [[ "$resp" =~ ^2[0-9][0-9]$ ]]
401/403: [[ "$resp" == "401" || "$resp" == "403" ]]

ROLE INFERENCE SAFETY
FILE ROLES map is authoritative. If missing or inconsistent, infer by filename:
*/auth.sh → AUTH, */crud.sh → CRUD, */smoke.sh → SMOKE.
The "role" value in the output must reflect the resolved role.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before returning, verify:
files.length equals manifest length; order preserved.
Each .sh ≤ 120 lines.
Endpoints only from ROLE CONTEXTS.
curl form and assertions exactly as specified.
Placeholders remain literal in outputs.
Final success line per file (e.g., "All <role> tests passed!").
