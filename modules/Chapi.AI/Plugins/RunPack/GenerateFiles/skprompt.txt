TOOLS
- Use runpack.AddFile(path, content) ONCE per manifest file.

FINAL RULE
- After adding ALL files, reply: DONE

INPUTS
FILES:
{{$files_manifest}}
ROLES (JSON path->role):
{{$file_roles_json}}
ROLE_CONTEXTS (role->endpoints):
{{$role_contexts_json}}
ENV: {{$env}}

OUTPUT FORMATS
- For files ending with .sh: content MUST be a Bash script that runs tests using curl.
- Shebang first line: #!/usr/bin/env bash
- Use: set -euo pipefail
- Use placeholders literally: ${BASE_URL}, ${TOKEN}, ${email}, ${id}
- Capture status: curl -sS --max-time 15 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"
- Print "PASS <name>" or "FAIL <name> (got <code>)" and exit non-zero on failure.
- No markdown/code fences; provide raw script as the content string.

ROLE RULES
AUTH:
- Use ROLE_CONTEXTS.AUTH only (protected endpoints; never "/" "/health" "/ping").
- Create exactly three tests on the SAME endpoint:
  1) no Authorization -> expect 401/403
  2) invalid token -> expect 401/403
  3) Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN} -> expect 2xx
- Suite path example: tests/<service>/auth.sh

SMOKE:
- 3–5 GET endpoints from ROLE_CONTEXTS.SMOKE; assert 2xx.

CRUD:
- 3–6 tests across create (POST), read (GET/{id}), update (PUT/PATCH), delete (DELETE) from ROLE_CONTEXTS.CRUD.
- Include one simple validation failure (expect 400).

CONSTRAINTS
- Max 6 tests per file.
- Each run must be independent; do not rely on prior tests.
- Use JSON bodies inline (-H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '<json>').

COMPLETION
- Call runpack.AddFile(path, content) once per file, then respond: DONE
